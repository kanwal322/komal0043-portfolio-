        <p>
          Hello! I'm <strong>Komal Kumari</strong>, a passionate fashion designer with a creative eye for detail and a love for exploring new ideas in design.
          My journey in the fashion world began with a fascination for colors, fabrics, and the art of expressing individuality through clothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in garment construction, fabric selection, and creative fashion concepts that bring stories to life through style. 
          From sketching designs to final stitching, I enjoy every step of the process that transforms imagination into wearable art.
        </p>
        <p>
          My inspiration often comes from nature, culture, and emotions — blending traditional and modern elements to create unique designs.
          I aim to make every piece meaningful, not just fashionable, and believe that fashion is a reflection of personality and confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m always eager to learn new techniques, experiment with textures, and push the boundaries of creativity to design something truly special.
